#Side-scroll ðŸ“œ

I created this extremely simple scrolling plugin for my aunts who
were looking to create some scrolling news text on their website.
It's very basic, and does one and only one thing: creates a right to
left scrolling text.

The shortcode is simple, once installed on WordPress on any page or in any post
just drop in  `[scroll text="your text here"]`.  Happy scrolling.

 Lets bring back that ole' <marquee> tag! (Please don't).

Potential future features:
* Left to right option
* Alter text size
* Alter text color
